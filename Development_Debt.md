# Development Debt: World Bank Lending

Against the backdrop of modern-day abundance, billions of people globally still suffer from a lack of basic necessities. The World Bank Group (WBG) strives resolve this irony, with a stated mission “to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity on a livable planet.” That is an admirable mission, but it raises questions:

"How much money has been lent in support of that mission?”

“How has lending to recipient countries changed over time?”

“What has the money been spent on?”

Before we answer those questions, it's important to understand the WBG's organizational structure to put the analysis that follows into perspective.
