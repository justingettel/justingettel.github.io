## iFood Insights: Food Delivery Discoveries

**Project description:** As I endeavor to sharpen my data skills, I’ve been tasked with analyzing data from food delivery company iFood, which is the Brazilian equivalent of DoorDash. To help optimize the results of future marketing campaigns, my analysis revealed spending patterns that could be leveraged by iFood to align their offering with customer tastes.

### 1. Key Takeaways & Recommendations

Multiple demographic factors and customer preferences across the 2,021 customers converge to reveal important details about food delivery spending through iFood. Most notable are the following:
•	The more money a customer makes, the more they are likely to spend on food delivery. It’s clear from this that higher income households need to be targeted by iFood marketing.
•	Customers fell into four age groups. As age rises, income rises. Therefore, we’d expect the oldest customers to spend the most as predicted by the Income vs. Total Spent scatterplot. Albeit the number of customers in the 66+ age group is the second lowest, so more revenue can be generated by targeting younger age groups that contain more customers as they buy a higher volume of goods.
•	Across six spending categories and all age groups, the most money was spent on wine and meat products. It’s not clear if total spending was highest in these categories because wine and meat are more expensive or because a higher quantity of wine and meat products were purchased. Nonetheless, there’s a clear affinity for them.
•	iFood ran several marketing campaigns. “Campaign six” had the highest acceptance rate and could serve as a model for future campaigns.

### 2. About the Dataset 

The data for this project was sourced from an iFood job interview case study. The data is 98% real but slightly modified for educational purposes. Here is a link to the original dataset: https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test/blob/master/ifood_df.csv. An Excel file version of it was provided by Data Career Jumpstart for analysis purposes.

### 3. Detailed Analysis

Approximately 67% of the variance in iFood spending can be explained by income level. The following scatterplot visualizes the correlation and was used to calculate the r-squared value (0.6711).

For purposes of the analysis, all customers were grouped into four buckets: 24-35, 36-50, 51-65, and 66+. Approximately 42% of the customers are aged 36-50. A mere 9.7% of the customers are 24-35. I expected the customer base to be even younger than it is, but perhaps the younger one is the less disposable income is available for use on services like food delivery.

Average income among those aged 66+ is $58,361 annually, which is the highest of all groups. Therefore, we’d expect this group to spend the most as predicted by the scatterplot. This holds true on a per capita basis. However, with a higher number of customers in other age groups, their total spending across all categories outpaces those in the 66+ group as revealed in the Spending by Product Type graph below.

Of the $1,228,184 spent, here is a breakdown of what was spent on each product type. Across all age groups and categories, spending on wine and meat products was the highest. Total spending was highest among those aged 51-65 at $450,502, representing nearly 37% of all spending.

Finally, the following chart reveals marketing campaign 6 had the highest acceptance rate across all customer ages, with ages 36-50 accepting it more than any group. Tactics used in this campaign must have resonated with them.

### 4. Closing Thoughts

The dataset analyzed contains numerous variables and further analysis could be done to identify the interplay between them to explain the what’s driving the remaining 33% of variance in spending.

As I continue to refine and expand my skills, stay tuned as I publish more projects utilizing other data tools.
